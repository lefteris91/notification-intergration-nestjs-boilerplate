    Explanation of the regex pattern:
    ^ asserts position at start of a line
    \\+ matches the character + literally (case sensitive)
    \\d matches a digit (equivalent to [0-9])
    {1,3} matches the previous token between 1 and 3 times, as many times as possible (greedy)
    \\. matches the character . literally (case sensitive)
    \\d matches a digit (equivalent to [0-9])
    {9,11} matches the previous token between 9 and 11 times, as many times as possible (greedy)
    $ asserts position at the end of a line`,
    example: '+XX.XXXXXXXXXX',
  })
